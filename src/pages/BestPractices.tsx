                      Starting from the first year, students are exposed to real-world legal proceedings through structured court visits, jail visits, and police station observations. This practice ensures that students understand the procedural nuances of the Indian legal system and the practical challenges of litigation.

Every student is mentored in memorial drafting and oral advocacy, preparing them for national-level competitions and successful professional careers in the higher judiciary.

                      Our Pharmacy Practice Cell actively organizes awareness camps in neighboring villages, where students provide free legal counseling under the supervision of faculty advocates. This practice fosters a sense of social responsibility and provides students with live experience in dealing with diverse pharmacy practice issues.
